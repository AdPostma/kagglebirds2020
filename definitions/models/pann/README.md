Preparation
-----------

To use a pretrained PANN model, we need its weights, which are available at
Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/record/3987831. To download the weights used by
default, you can directly run:

```bash
wget -cO Cnn14_16k_mAP=0.438.pth 'https://zenodo.org/record/3987831/files/Cnn14_16k_mAP%3D0.438.pth?download=1'
```
